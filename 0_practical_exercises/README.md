# Practical Exercises

For simplicity, we will use only one image to execute all examples. In production, we need to have different containers for training and inference. For more details, see the documentation here.
- [SageMaker Training Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-training-toolkit)
- [SageMaker Inference Toolkit](https://github.com/aws/sagemaker-inference-toolkit)

To make the code useful for real applications, we are using scripts instead of notebooks. In VS Code, you will be able to execute the code in cells and the project contains the configuration (docker files and devcontainer.json) to execute the code in a remote container, so that you can reproduce the same results. For more details see the documentation [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers).

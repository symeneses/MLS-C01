# MLS-C01

Review material and practice exercises to prepare for the exam.
The content is intended as tool to **remember** the domains to be tested, thus, the notebooks contain short exercises useful to see some concepts (no AWS) in action and the notes explains *the theoretical minimum* (Yeah! I know I am not Leonard Susskind) in simple words of topics that are very complex and vast.

The material is organized in the 4 domains of the exam and one practical, which contains exercises using AWS services and applying ML common tools.
1. [Data Engineering](1_data_engineering/README.md)
2. [Data Analysis](2_data_analysis/README.md)
3. [Modelling](3_modelling/README.md)
4. [Implementation](4_implementation/README.md)
5. [Practical exercises in AWS](0_practical_exercises/README.md)

# S3

Stores objects (csv, parquet, JSON, etc) with a max size of % TB in buckets with a **unique name**.
Its main purpose is to have storage capacity independently from computing.

1. **Life cycle** 
Buckets can be moved through different *S3 Storage Tiers* when Standard is for general purposes, going to Standard-Infrequent Access (IA), One Zone-Infrequent Access or Intelligent Tiering, which offer less availability to a lower price.
Amazon Glacier can be used to archive.
Then, buckets can transition from Standard (frequent used) to less frequent following *transaction actions* and can be deleted with *expiration actions*.

2. **Data partitioning**
A bucket can have partitions (folders) which should be defined according to how the data is query.
The partitioning can be handle by extra tools (i.e AWS Glue)

3. **Security**

- Encryption:
    - SSE-S3: Server Side managed by AWS
    - SSE-KMS: Server Side with key managed by the *Key Management Service* which can be monitored by the user. 
- Access:
    - User Base: Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies
    - Resource Base: Object Access Control List
    - Networking: VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) Endpoint Gateway
